            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi my name is Arvin and I want to teach <b>programming and math.</b>
                I've done a lot of Python and Roblox LUAU programming, and I'm excellent at math.
                Classes are also meant to be with other people, however, I am open to 1 to 1 classes if you want to.
                I have always achieved math grades of 95% or higher, and I have a lot of experience with Python and Roblox LUAU programming.
                The classes are designed for people who are bored of block-based coding and want a tougher challenge, which is a major problem for some people.
            </p>

                    <h4>Experience</h4>
                    <p>I have learned python since <b>one and a half years ago</b>
                         and I have completed several certificarions from classes and courses. 
                         I have done big projects aswell like a Fisch Macro with OpenCV, PySide6/PyQT5, json, sys,os, and math imports.
                         I have also done a lot of Roblox LUAU programming, I made games with the use of advanced scripting.
                         I have done mini-projects aswell with the use of Object Oriented programming, in both languages.
                         I have also done some projects with the use of GitHub, and I am familiar with the basics of Git.
                         I've achieved a lot of awards from my school for math aswell.
