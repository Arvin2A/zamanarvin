        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi my name is Arvin and I really want to teach programming to people who want to know about it. 
            However, I am free to teach to people who want to get into the basics.
            I done a lot of Python (1 and a half years of experience) and Roblox LUAU programming (4 years of experience). 
            For roblox LUAU programming, I am also able to teach you how to design models using Blender.
            Classes are also meant to be with other people so that no one is feeling bored or lonely. However, I am open to 1 to 1 classes if you want to.
            The classes are designed for people who are bored of block-based coding and want a tougher challenge, which is a major problem for some people.
        </p>
